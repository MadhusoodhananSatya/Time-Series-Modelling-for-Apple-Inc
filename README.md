üåü Time Series Analysis of Apple Stock Prices
This project provides a comprehensive time series analysis of Apple (AAPL) stock closing prices. It employs and compares three distinct forecasting models‚ÄîARIMA, Holt-Winters, and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)‚Äîto predict future stock prices. The goal is to identify which model provides the most accurate forecast based on key performance metrics.

The core of this project is a data science pipeline written in R that starts with data loading and preprocessing, followed by an in-depth time series decomposition to understand the underlying trends, seasonality, and randomness. The script then applies the forecasting models and evaluates their performance to determine the most effective predictive method. The analysis addresses common challenges in financial data, such as non-stationarity, to ensure the models are robust and reliable.

‚ú® Key Features & Technical Details
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The script loads historical AAPL stock data from a CSV file. It correctly formats the dates and arranges the data chronologically, selecting only the Close price for the analysis.

Time Series Decomposition: The program decomposes the time series into its core components: trend, which represents the long-term movement of the price; seasonality, which captures recurring patterns (like yearly cycles); and a random component, which accounts for unpredictable fluctuations. A multiplicative model is used, as it's assumed the magnitude of seasonal and random fluctuations increases with the stock price.

Stationarity Testing: A crucial step for time series analysis is ensuring the data is stationary, meaning its statistical properties (like mean and variance) remain constant over time. The code performs the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, it indicates non-stationarity, and the script applies first-order differencing to transform the data, making it suitable for the ARIMA model.

Model Implementation & Forecasting:

ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): This is a powerful model that combines three key components. AR (Auto-Regressive) uses past values to predict the future, I (Integrated) uses differencing to achieve stationarity, and MA (Moving Average) uses past forecast errors to improve predictions. The script automatically identifies the optimal parameters for the model.

Holt-Winters: This model is an extension of exponential smoothing that explicitly accounts for trend and seasonality. The script uses a multiplicative seasonality model to capture seasonal patterns.

Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES): This is a simple yet effective model that provides a baseline forecast. It gives exponentially decreasing weights to older observations, meaning recent data has a greater influence on the forecast.

Model Evaluation: The forecast accuracy of each model is evaluated on a test set using two key metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Both metrics measure the average magnitude of the errors, with a lower value indicating a more accurate model.

üöÄ Getting Started
To run this project, you will need an R environment with the following libraries:

ggplot2

dplyr

forecast

tseries

TTR

You can set up the environment and run the analysis by cloning the repository and executing the Time Series Analysis.R file in an RStudio environment.

üìä Project Workflow
The Time Series Analysis.R script follows a structured workflow:

Data Loading and Inspection: The script begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the AAPL.csv dataset. It then converts the date column to the correct format and arranges the data.

Visualization & Decomposition: The raw time series data is plotted, followed by a decomposition into its trend, seasonal, and random components to provide an initial understanding of the data's behavior.

Data Preparation: The script splits the data into training and testing sets. It then checks for stationarity using the ADF test and applies differencing to the training data if needed, ensuring the data is ready for modeling.

Model Building & Evaluation: The ARIMA, Holt-Winters, and SES models are built and trained on the prepared data. The script then generates forecasts for each model and evaluates their performance against the test data using RMSE and MAE, with the results compiled into a comparison table.

üìà Final Thoughts
This project serves as a practical guide to time series forecasting in R. The analysis demonstrates how different models can capture varying aspects of the data, with the ARIMA model proving to be a highly effective tool for forecasting non-stationary financial data. The project provides a solid foundation for further exploration, such as experimenting with more advanced models like Prophet or implementing more sophisticated feature engineering.
